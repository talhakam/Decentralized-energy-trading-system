⚡ Decentralized Energy Trading System 🔗
A Web3 decentralized application (DApp) for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading using blockchain technology. This project enables secure and transparent energy transactions without intermediaries, leveraging Ethereum smart contracts.

📖 Project Description
The Decentralized Energy Trading System is a blockchain-based platform that allows prosumers (producers + consumers) to buy and sell electricity directly. The system eliminates the need for centralized energy providers by using smart contracts to facilitate transactions securely.

The project is built using React.js, Solidity, and Web3.js and runs on a private Ethereum blockchain using Geth.

🔥 Why Use Blockchain for Energy Trading?
✔️ Trustless Transactions – No need for third-party verification.
✔️ Security & Transparency – All transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
✔️ Decentralization – Eliminates central authorities and reduces costs.
✔️ Automated Execution – Smart contracts handle transactions without manual intervention.

🚀 Features
✅ Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Energy Trading – Users can trade energy without intermediaries.
✅ Smart Contracts – Secure and automated transactions using Solidity.
✅ Blockchain-Based Transactions – Transactions recorded on a private Ethereum network.
✅ MetaMask & Web3.js Integration – Users can connect their wallets for secure payments.
✅ Real-Time Energy Pricing – Prices are dynamically updated based on supply and demand.
✅ User Authentication – Secure login and wallet integration via MetaMask.
✅ Admin Dashboard – Manage users, transactions, and smart contract interactions.

🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend
React.js – For building the UI.
Web3.js – For blockchain interaction.
MetaMask – Wallet authentication.
Backend
Node.js & Express.js – Server-side logic.
MongoDB – (Optional) For storing user data.
Blockchain
Ethereum Private Network (Geth) – For decentralized transactions.
Solidity – Smart contract programming.
Truffle & Ganache – Smart contract development & testing.
🛠️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/talhakam/Decentralized-energy-trading-system.git
cd Decentralized-energy-trading-system
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3️⃣ Start the Ethereum Private Network (Geth)
Set up a private blockchain using Geth:

bash
Copy
Edit
geth --datadir ./data init genesis.json
geth --datadir ./data --networkid 1234 --http --http.api eth,net,web3,personal,miner
4️⃣ Deploy Smart Contracts (Using Truffle)
Compile and migrate the contracts to the private blockchain:

bash
Copy
Edit
truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development
5️⃣ Run the Frontend (React App)
bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

📝 How It Works
1️⃣ Users Connect MetaMask – They log in and authorize transactions via MetaMask.
2️⃣ Energy Providers List Energy – Producers upload energy availability.
3️⃣ Smart Contracts Execute Trades – Buyers purchase energy directly from sellers.
4️⃣ Blockchain Records Transactions – Ensures transparency and security.
